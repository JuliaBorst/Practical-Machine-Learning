# Practical-Machine-Learning - Project Week 4

Introduction

The goal of the project is  to use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants. They were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways. More information is available from the website here: http://web.archive.org/web/20161224072740/http:/groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har (see the section on the Weight Lifting Exercise Dataset).

The following steps are taken to build the best predictive model:
1. Getting and exploring the Data
2. Cross Validation
3. Model Building
4. Analysis of Accuracy
5. Predicting for the test set
